<!--  You are creating a simple comment filtering system for a blog site. You need to write a JavaScript function that takes a user's comment and performs the following:
Check whether the comment contains any of the following banned words: "bad", "ugly", or "stupid" (case-insensitive).
If it contains a banned word, replace it with "***" using a regular expression.
Count how many numbers are mentioned in the comment.
Count how many words in the comment begin with a capital letter.
Return a final message with the cleaned comment, number count, and capitalized word count.
Test the function with this comment:
 "I think this movie was BAD and 100% Stupid! But the Acting was Amazing and 3 actors were great.-->
<body>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        comment="I think this movie was BAD and 100% Stupid! But the Acting was Amazing and 3 actors were great."
       function filter(comment){
        newcomment=comment.replace(/\b(bad|ugly|stupid)\b/gi,"***")
        console.log(comment)
        var hasDigits =comment.match(/\d+/g)
        console.log(hasDigits.length)
        var hasWord =newcomment.match(/\b[A-Z][a-z]*/g)
        console.log(hasWord.length) 
        output=`comment is ="${comment}" after replacing = "${newcomment}" number of digits= "${hasDigits.length}" number of words="${hasWord.length}"`
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=output
       }
    filter(comment)
    </script>
