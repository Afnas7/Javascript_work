<!-- Create a simple web-based event reminder tool. The page should take a user's input of a past date (for example, their last birthday) and display:
The year, month (name, not number), and day of that date.
How many full years have passed since that date.
A custom message that says:
“It has been more than a year since that date.”
or “It has been less than a year since that date.” -->
