<!-- You are building a small statistics widget for a website.
Generate a random whole number between 1 and 100.
Simulate a user score as a string value (like "75").
Convert the user score string to a number using type conversion (without using any conditionals).
Show the difference between the random number and user score.
Show the rounded square root of the user score.
Show the Ï€ constant (pi) from JavaScript.
Convert the string "50" to a number using implicit conversion and multiply it by 2. -->
